## About

WerdNerd is an app that uses Merriam-Webster&apos;s Collegiate® Thesaurus API to create word-matching games for developing one’s vocabulary. Users can utilize pre-assembled word-lists for their games, or create their own if they are logged-in. Each game pulls randomly-selected synonyms for each word in it&apos;s word-list, so that every game with a given word-list is different!

Built with:

- Ruby on Rails
- React.js
- JWT authorization
- PostgreSQL
- HTML, CSS, BootStrap
- Merriam-Webster&apos;s Collegiate® Thesaurus API
- Deployed with Heroku
